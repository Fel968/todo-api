"express" package
difference between node and npm
package-lock.json is used by npm. Never tamper with it.
git ignore
use "nodemon" package to referesh the page/to track changes
Note that there can be malicious packages on npm express

read on controllers and routes
flow: model,controller,router,index.js

router uses controllers
index.js uses routers

there are other packages for different types of jobs. find different kind of web jobs that can be done with apis/databases
express is only for taking and returning requests from users
